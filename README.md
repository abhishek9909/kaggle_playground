## Rough Plan:
- v0 contains:
    -> simple EDA for features - univariate and bivariate.
    -> two models trained with both equally distributed and stratified datasets.
    -> classification report for the observations.
    -> a N-numeric one-vs-all approach towards classification.

- v1 will contain:
    - Feature importance based on model predictions.
        - Existing model
            - plot feature importance. :: embedded methods.
            - plot the decision boundaries.
                - see if they are linear / non-linear; if non-linear, we must use SVM as the decision maker/estimator in the feature importance methods.
        - Ablate features;
            - Recursive feature elimination; in this method, use a logistic regression model to check which features are most important.
            - Feature permutation importance;
            - Sequential feature selection; 
    - Providing mathematical confidence interval for different settings of classifiers:
        - Multi-class classifier.
        - One vs. all classifiers.
        - n*(n-1)/2 one vs. one classifiers.;;
        with justification for which model should have best generalization performance considering the metric.
    - Perform more exploratory feature engineering using structured techniques.
    - Model and hyperparameter selection based on structured approach.
        - loss curves.
        - search based on heuristic logarithmic varying inputs.
    - Model evaluation and selection based on metrics
        - classification report.
        - ROC curves.
        - statisitical tests - mcnemar's report.
    - Final model submission.
        - trained on the entire set with same set of hyperparameters.
